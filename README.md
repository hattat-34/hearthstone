# Bare React Native Project

A Basic challenge which uses hearthstone rapidapi. Basically, fetched all cards(around 11k) with card stats, descriptions, properties etc... All cards are displayed on the list elegantly and performantly. Also listed all unique card mechanics can be filtered by selected mechanic. The screen also have the ability which gives users to search for a card.

Note: Business layer structured by useReducer hook instead of react-redux. React-redux could be implemented if we need to manage to shared app state throughout screens.
